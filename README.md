WeRent is a website application that  allows users to rent rooms or flats that have been posted on the application by hosts.

## Description


WeRent is a website application where users can rent rooms or flats posted by hosts. Registered users can search for rentals using various filters and keywords, add favorites, and view nearby postings on an interactive map. Clicking on a rental displays its details, location map, and reviews. Users can reserve a rental by specifying duration and number of occupants, adding it to their shopping cart, and proceeding to checkout for payment. The profile page allows users to manage personal information, access booking history, and submit landmark suggestions. Hosts can create and manage rentals, while admins oversee the application, including user reports, posts, suggestions, and reviews, with the ability to delete content and access statistical reports.
